#### DEPENDENCIES:
* NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* You have the install the following global dependencies with NPM:  
Typescript  
Typings  
Angular-CLI

#### USAGE:
Run `npm install` in terminal to download the dependencies, and after it is done run `ng serve` to start the app.
After its started, it can be reached at `http://localhost:4200`

You also have to start the NodeJS server, just open the folder called `node-server` and install its dependencies too. So hit `npm install` again (inside the `node-server` folder of course), and when it is finished, run the `runServer.sh` script in your terminal.
